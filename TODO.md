# Main Idea
Currently just a mockup.

## MVP
- connect via:
  - google calendar account
  - spotify music
- display on calendar as events in a new spotify calendar
  - color of album? or just spotify...
  - include link to song on spotify

## Even better
- youtube
- netflix
- easily fuzzy searching through history
- aggregate all of the data in a nice panel
